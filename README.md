# oil-price-study
A study of the relationships between crude oil prices (Brent Futures), S&amp;P500 stocks prices, USDX and US Treasury Bills

This project aims to identify the quantitative relationships between 4 categories:
- Commodity (Brent Oil Futures)
- Stocks (S&P 500)
- Bonds (US Treasury Bonds)
- Currencies (USDX)
The above 4 categories are selected with reference to an article by the EIA:
https://www.eia.gov/finance/markets/crudeoil/financial_markets.php#:~:text=Economic%20conditions%20can%20cause%20prices,(or%20fall)%20as%20well.

A simple correlation between each of the categories against Brent Oil Futures will be calculated and charted.
